## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-19

### üöÄ Major Features Added

#### Advanced Natural Language Processing
- **Intent Detection**: Automatically detects user intent (create, compress, search, download, install, etc.)
- **Query Processing**: Sophisticated parsing with action/target recognition
- **Synonym Expansion**: Understands alternatives like "folder" ‚Üí "directory", "get" ‚Üí "download"
- **Stop Word Removal**: Filters out noise words for cleaner matching

#### Enhanced Search Capabilities
- **Domain-Specific Matching**: Maps queries to relevant command domains
- **Fuzzy Search**: Built-in typo tolerance using Levenshtein distance
- **Hybrid Search Algorithm**: Combines exact, fuzzy, and semantic matching
- **Advanced Scoring**: Multi-factor relevance calculation with domain-specific boosts

#### Search History & Analytics
- **Usage Tracking**: Persistent search history with JSON storage
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Search statistics and success rates
- **Personalized Results**: Frequently used commands get priority boosts
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Smart history management

#### Improved Context Detection
- **15+ Project Types**: Expanded from basic Git/Docker to comprehensive project detection
- **Smart Boosts**: Project-aware command prioritization
- **Multi-Context Support**: Handles projects with multiple technologies

### ‚ú® Improvements

#### Search Quality
- **Better Relevance Scoring**: Fixed issues where wrong commands appeared at top of results
- **Category Relevance Boosting**: Commands get extra points for category-specific matches
- **Penalty System**: Reduces scores for mismatched tools (e.g., find commands for compression queries)
- **Exact Match Prioritization**: Heavily weights exact command name matches

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Sub-30ms Search**: Improved from ~50ms to often under 30ms response times
- **Efficient NLP**: Lightweight processing without external dependencies
- **Memory Management**: Smart caching and cleanup for long-running sessions
- **Real-time Fuzzy Search**: Typo correction with minimal performance impact

#### User Experience
- **Verbose Mode**: Shows NLP analysis and scoring details for debugging
- **Enhanced Output**: Relevance scores and better formatted results
- **Command Examples**: More comprehensive examples in search results

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Search Relevance**: Fixed "compress files" returning find commands instead of tar/zip
- **Directory Creation**: Fixed "create directory" returning makepkg instead of mkdir
- **Keyword Expansion**: Limited over-aggressive synonym expansion that diluted results
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Improved prioritization of most relevant commands

### üìö Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Comprehensive rewrite with new features and examples
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Updated to reflect new NLP and search components
- **Performance Metrics**: Updated benchmarks and specifications
- **Feature Documentation**: Detailed explanations of NLP and search capabilities

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Changes
- **New Packages**: Added `internal/nlp/`, `internal/search/`, `internal/history/`
- **Enhanced Database Schema**: Better command categorization and keyword support
- **Improved Test Coverage**: Additional tests for new functionality
- **Code Organization**: Better separation of concerns and modularity
