wtf "git" --verbose                  # Show scoring details
wtf "commands" --database custom.yml # Custom database
```

### üß† Context-Aware Search

WTF automatically detects your environment and prioritizes relevant commands:

```bash
# In a Git repository
wtf "commit"          # Prioritizes git commands

# Directory with Dockerfile  
wtf "build"           # Prioritizes docker commands

# Directory with package.json
wtf "install"         # Prioritizes npm commands
```

### üéØ Interactive Command Wizards

Build complex commands step-by-step with interactive wizards:

```bash
# Interactive tar archive builder
wtf wizard tar
‚Üí What do you want to do? [c]reate/e[x]tract: c
‚Üí Archive name: backup.tar.gz
‚Üí Files to archive: /home/user/documents
‚Üí Result: tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/documents
