## 📚 Complete Feature Guide

### 🔍 Core Search

```bash
# Natural language search with advanced NLP
wtf "compress files"                 # Finds tar, zip, gzip commands
wtf "create directory"               # Prioritizes mkdir over other tools
wtf "download file"                  # Returns wget, curl commands
wtf "git commands"                   # Git-specific operations

# Advanced search options
wtf search "docker" --limit 10       # More results
wtf search "process" --verbose       # Show relevance scores and NLP analysis
wtf search "commands" --database custom.yml # Custom database

# Fuzzy search handles typos
wtf "comprss files"                  # Still finds compression commands
wtf "mkdir direectory"               # Still finds directory commands
```

### 🧠 Advanced Natural Language Processing

WTF now includes sophisticated NLP features for better command understanding:

**Intent Detection**:
- `create` → Prioritizes mkdir, touch, make commands
- `compress` → Focuses on tar, zip, gzip tools  
- `search` → Emphasizes grep, find, locate commands
- `download` → Highlights wget, curl, fetch tools
- `install` → Boosts package managers (apt, pip, npm)

**Query Processing**:
- **Action Recognition**: Identifies verbs like "compress", "extract", "download"
- **Target Detection**: Recognizes objects like "file", "directory", "package"
- **Synonym Expansion**: "folder" → "directory", "get" → "download"
- **Stop Word Removal**: Filters out "the", "and", "with" for cleaner matching

**Example NLP in action**:
```bash
wtf "I want to compress some files into an archive"
# Detects: Intent=compress, Action=compress, Target=files
# Returns: tar, zip, gzip commands with high relevance scores

wtf "help me create a new directory please"  
# Detects: Intent=create, Action=create, Target=directory
# Returns: mkdir commands prioritized over other creation tools
```

### 🧠 Context-Aware Search

WTF automatically detects your environment and prioritizes relevant commands:

```bash
# In a Git repository
wtf "commit"          # Prioritizes git commands

# Directory with Dockerfile  
wtf "build"           # Prioritizes docker commands

# Directory with package.json
wtf "install"         # Prioritizes npm commands

# Directory with Makefile
wtf "build"           # Prioritizes make commands

# Python project (requirements.txt, .py files)
wtf "install"         # Prioritizes pip commands
```

**Context Detection Features**:
- **15+ Project Types**: Git, Docker, Node.js, Python, Go, Rust, Java, and more
- **File Pattern Recognition**: Detects project files like package.json, Dockerfile, go.mod
- **Smart Boosts**: Gives relevant commands higher priority scores
- **Multi-Context Support**: Handles projects with multiple technologies

### 🎯 Interactive Command Wizards

Build complex commands step-by-step with interactive wizards:

```bash
# Interactive tar archive builder
wtf wizard tar
→ What do you want to do? [c]reate/e[x]tract: c
→ Archive name: backup.tar.gz
→ Files to archive: /home/user/documents
→ Result: tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/documents

# Interactive find command builder  
wtf wizard find
→ Starting directory: .
→ File name pattern: *.log
→ Result: find . -name "*.log"

# Interactive ffmpeg converter
wtf wizard ffmpeg
→ Input file: video.mp4
→ Output format: mp3
→ Result: ffmpeg -i video.mp4 output.mp3
```

### 🔗 Pipeline Search

Find and visualize multi-step command workflows:

```bash
wtf pipeline "text processing"
wtf pipeline "log analysis" 
wtf pipeline "find and replace"

# Example output:
📋 Found pipeline command:
find . -name "*.txt" │ xargs grep "error" │ head -10
📝 find text files and show first 10 errors
🔗 Pipeline steps:
   1. find . -name "*.txt"
   2. xargs grep "error" 
   3. head -10
```

### � Search History & Analytics

WTF tracks your search patterns to provide better recommendations:

```bash
# View search history
wtf history

# Recent searches:
# 1. "compress files" → tar -czf (3 times today)
# 2. "git commit" → git commit -m (2 times today)  
# 3. "docker build" → docker build . (1 time today)

# Search analytics
wtf history --stats

# 📊 Search Statistics:
# Total searches: 47
# Most searched: "git commands" (8 times)
# Success rate: 94% (commands found vs not found)
# Average results per search: 4.2
```

**History Benefits**:
- **Personalized Results**: Frequently used commands get slight priority boosts
- **Usage Patterns**: Understand your command habits
- **Success Tracking**: See which searches work best
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Old history automatically managed

### 📝 Personal Command Notebook

Save and organize your custom commands:

```bash
# Save a regular command
wtf save
→ Command: docker ps -a --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
→ Description: Show docker containers with custom format
→ Keywords: docker, containers, format
→ Saved to personal notebook!

# Save a pipeline workflow
wtf save-pipeline  
→ Command: find . -name "*.log" | grep -v "debug" | tail -20
→ Description: Get recent non-debug log entries
→ Keywords: logs, debug, recent
→ Saved to personal notebook!

# Your commands appear in all searches
wtf "docker containers"  # Shows both official and your custom commands
```
