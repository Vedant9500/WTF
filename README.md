## 📚 Complete Feature Guide

### 🔍 Core Search

```bash
# Basic search (default behavior)
wtf "list files"
wtf search "process monitoring" 

# Advanced options
wtf "docker" --limit 10              # More results
wtf "git" --verbose                  # Show scoring details
wtf "commands" --database custom.yml # Custom database
```

### 🧠 Context-Aware Search

WTF automatically detects your environment and prioritizes relevant commands:

```bash
# In a Git repository
wtf "commit"          # Prioritizes git commands

# Directory with Dockerfile  
wtf "build"           # Prioritizes docker commands

# Directory with package.json
wtf "install"         # Prioritizes npm commands
```

### 🎯 Interactive Command Wizards

Build complex commands step-by-step with interactive wizards:

```bash
# Interactive tar archive builder
wtf wizard tar
→ What do you want to do? [c]reate/e[x]tract: c
→ Archive name: backup.tar.gz
→ Files to archive: /home/user/documents
→ Result: tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/documents

# Interactive find command builder  
wtf wizard find
→ Starting directory: .
→ File name pattern: *.log
→ Result: find . -name "*.log"

# Interactive ffmpeg converter
wtf wizard ffmpeg
→ Input file: video.mp4
→ Output format: mp3
→ Result: ffmpeg -i video.mp4 output.mp3
```

### 🔗 Pipeline Search

Find and visualize multi-step command workflows:

```bash
wtf pipeline "text processing"
wtf pipeline "log analysis" 
wtf pipeline "find and replace"

# Example output:
📋 Found pipeline command:
find . -name "*.txt" │ xargs grep "error" │ head -10
📝 find text files and show first 10 errors
🔗 Pipeline steps:
   1. find . -name "*.txt"
   2. xargs grep "error" 
   3. head -10
```

### 📝 Personal Command Notebook

Save and organize your custom commands:

```bash
# Save a regular command
wtf save
→ Command: docker ps -a --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
→ Description: Show docker containers with custom format
→ Keywords: docker, containers, format
→ Saved to personal notebook!

# Save a pipeline workflow
wtf save-pipeline  
→ Command: find . -name "*.log" | grep -v "debug" | tail -20
→ Description: Get recent non-debug log entries
→ Keywords: logs, debug, recent
→ Saved to personal notebook!

# Your commands appear in all searches
wtf "docker containers"  # Shows both official and your custom commands
```
